autosave-with-structure
=======================

Edit in a textarea with autosave. Fine.

But what if you want a document with some pre-ordained structure to it?  Say, so that users can fill in a template but the sections are pre-established and not to be trifled with?

So here we have autosave-with-structure.  Define your structure in JSON for the document, each autosave verifies that the structure still matches before saving.
